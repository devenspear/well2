# Email Setup Guide

## Current Implementation

The wellness app now has **client-side PDF generation** with **email sharing capabilities**!

### âœ… What's Working Now

1. **PDF Download**: Users can download a detailed PDF report with their wellness scores and recommendations
2. **Email Sharing**: Users can share their results via their default email client

### ðŸš€ Enhanced Email Options

For professional email delivery with PDF attachments, you can set up EmailJS:

## Option 1: EmailJS Setup (Recommended)

1. **Sign up at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)**
2. **Create an Email Service**:
   - Go to Email Services
   - Add Gmail, Outlook, or other email provider
   - Note your Service ID

3. **Create an Email Template**:
   - Go to Email Templates
   - Create a new template with variables:
     - `{{to_email}}` - recipient email
     - `{{user_name}}` - user's name/age
     - `{{overall_score}}` - wellness score
     - `{{assessment_date}}` - assessment date
   - Note your Template ID

4. **Get Your Public Key**:
   - Go to Account â†’ API Keys
   - Copy your Public Key

5. **Update Configuration**:
   - Open `utils/emailService.js`
   - Replace the placeholder values:
     ```javascript
     const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
       serviceId: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVICE_ID',
       templateId: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_TEMPLATE_ID', 
       publicKey: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY'
     };
     ```

6. **Enable EmailJS in FinalCTA**:
   - In `components/FinalCTA.js`, replace `sendEmailFallback` with `sendWellnessReport`

## Option 2: Current Fallback (Working Now)

The app currently uses the browser's default email client:
